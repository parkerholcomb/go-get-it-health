# About gogetit.health

For the past couple months, üëãüèæ Dwamian, Scott, and I have been working on a way to help, and today we're finally able to release our our #gogetit bot.

If you're looking for #covid #vaccine availability in #Texas, just text your zip code to 512-409-9745 or visit https://gogetit.health to get started.

It started with "How can I find my Dad the next available vaccine". Refreshing dozens of websites wasn't going to cut it, I wanted to get a push notification as soon as supply became available. After he got his vaccine in March, this morphed into "how can we get out this information out to people as simply as possible".

We are now actively tracking almost 4,000 locations across Texas for supply updates (through the Texas Department of Emergency Management), and if there's updated availability within 50 miles of your zip code, you'll be the first to know.

Y'all - the time is now to lean in, advocate for your health and the health of your community, and #gogetit.
